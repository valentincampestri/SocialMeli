The creation of a REST API is proposed to:

• Perform the "Follow" action on a specific user.

• Obtain the result of the number of users following a specific seller.

• Obtain a list of all users following a specific seller ("Who follows me?").

• Obtain a list of all sellers followed by a specific user ("Who do I follow?").

• Carry out the publication of a new product on promotion.

• Obtain the quantity of products on promotion from a specific seller.

• Obtain a list of all products on promotion from a specific seller.

• Obtain a list of publications made in the last two weeks by the sellers a user follows (consider sorting by date, with the most recent publications first).

• Perform the "Unfollow" action on a specific seller.

• Perform unit and integration tests.


Furthermore, as a good user experience is desired regarding the presentation of the results of each query, it is necessary that they can be sorted by any of the following criteria:

• Alphabetical Ascending and Descending.

• Date Ascending and Descending.
